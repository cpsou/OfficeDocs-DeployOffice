# Supported scenarios for installing different versions of Office, Project, and Visio on the same computer

In many cases, you can install Office, Project, and Visio on the same computer. However, there are some combinations of Office, Project, and Visio that can't be installed together.

The two main factors that determine compatibility are the [version](#office-releases-and-their-version-number) of the product and the [installation technology](#installation-technologies-used-by-office). The following rules govern compatibility:

- You can't install two products with the same version but different installation technologies.
- You can't install two products of different versions if both use Click-to-Run and have overlapping Office applications.

See the [example installation scenarios](#example-installation-scenarios) section for supported and unsupported scenarios, with explanations.

## Office releases and their version number

The table below lists supported Office releases, their versions, and [installation technology](#installation-technologies-used-by-office). This information applies to Project and Visio as well.

| Office release                                      | Version | Installation technologies                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft 365                                       | 16.0    | Click-to-Run, Microsoft Store                 |
| Office Long Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) 2024      | 16.0    | Click-to-Run                                  |
| Office LTSC 2021                                    | 16.0    | Click-to-Run                                  |
| Office 2021                                         | 16.0    | Click-to-Run                                  |
| Office 2019                                         | 16.0    | Click-to-Run, Microsoft Store                 |
| Office 2016                                         | 16.0    | Click-to-Run, Windows Installer (MSI), Microsoft Store |

Find this version information in **Control Panel** > **Programs and Features** or in an app’s **About** dialog, for example, **File** > **Account** > **About Word**. For more information, see [Find details for other versions of Office](https://support.microsoft.com/office/8e83dd74-3b83-4528-bda6-6ff6118f8293).

> [!NOTE]
> - Microsoft 365, Office LTSC 2024, Office LTSC 2021, Office 2021, Office 2019, and Office 2016 share the same version number: 16.0.
> - Office 2013, which is no longer supported, had version 15.0.
> - Office 2010, also unsupported, had version 14.0 and used Windows Installer (MSI).

## Installation technologies used by Office

Office, Project, and Visio are available through different purchasing methods, which determine the installation technology used:

- **Click-to-Run**
- **Windows Installer (MSI)**
- **Microsoft Store**

In newer releases, go to **File** > **Account** in an Office app to check the installation technology under **Product Information**.

You can also identify Click-to-Run by the presence of **Update Options** in **Product Information**. If **Update Options** and any mention of Microsoft Store are both absent, it was installed with Windows Installer (MSI).

The Microsoft Store technology is used only when purchasing Office from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/).

## Example installation scenarios

Here are some example installation scenarios with explanations for whether they're supported.

| Products to install                                       | Supported?                  | Explanation                                                                  |

<sup>1</sup> Requires Version 2408 or later of Microsoft 365 Apps for compatibility with Project 2024, Visio LTSC 2024, and Visio 2024.  
<sup>2</sup> Requires Version 2108 or later for compatibility with Project 2021, Visio LTSC 2021, and Visio 2021.

## Additional information

- All installed products must match in bit version (32-bit or 64-bit). For example, you can't install a 32-bit version of Visio on the same computer with a 64-bit version of Office.
- Volume licensed versions of Office LTSC 2024, Office LTSC 2021, and Office 2019 use Click-to-Run, while Office 2016 uses Windows Installer (MSI).
- Products installed on the same computer must use the same [update channel](../updates/overview-update-channels.md). For example, the volume licensed version of Office Professional Plus 2019 can only use the PerpetualVL2019 update channel.
- Volume licensed Project and Visio installations must be configured to use the same update channel as Microsoft 365 Apps.
